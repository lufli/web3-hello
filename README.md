# Sample Hardhat Project

## Summary

This project helped me become familiar with the latest Web3 ecosystem and tooling.

## Update Jul 9, 2025

Alternatively, contracts can be deployed using ethers.js or web3.js directly. To do so, I simply added a new deployment script that leverages ethers.js.

## Things to Learn

1. Wrote a simple Inbox smart contract in Solidity and developed unit tests for it.
2. Gained hands-on experience with Hardhat, including compiling contracts, running unit tests, and deploying to a test network using the CLI.
3. Learned how to configure various Hardhat settings for development and deployment.

## Command lines

1. Compile contract
```shell
npm run compile
```

2. Test contract
```shell
npm run test
```

3. Deploy contract (ignition or ether.js)
```shell
npm run deploy
```
Or 
```shell
npm run deploy-ethers
```
