# Sample Hardhat Project

## Summary

This project helped me become familiar with the latest Web3 ecosystem and tooling.

## Things to Learn

1. Wrote a simple Inbox smart contract in Solidity and developed unit tests for it.
2. Gained hands-on experience with Hardhat, including compiling contracts, running unit tests, and deploying to a test network using the CLI.
3. Learned how to configure various Hardhat settings for development and deployment.

## Command lines

1. Compile contract
```shell
npx run compile
```

2. Test contract
```shell
npx run compile
```

3. Deploy contract
```shell
npx run compile
```

4. Check deployed contract [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/)
